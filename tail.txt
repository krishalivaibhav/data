Getting Set Up with Tailwind UI

Requirements:
Ensure Tailwind UI components are designed for Tailwind CSS v3.4. Update Tailwind CSS via npm:
npm install tailwindcss@latest
Additional plugins like @tailwindcss/forms, @tailwindcss/typography, and @tailwindcss/aspect-ratio are used in some examples, check comments for details.

Optional: Add the Inter font family
For a consistent look, add the Inter font via CDN:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://rsms.me/inter/inter.css">
Add "Inter var" to your "sans" font family in Tailwind config:
// tailwind.config.js
const defaultTheme = require('tailwindcss/defaultTheme')

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ['Inter var', ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
}
Using HTML and Your Own JS:
Components provided in React, Vue, and vanilla HTML formats.
JavaScript may be required for interactive components (e.g., dropdowns). Comments guide JS implementation.

Accessibility Considerations:
Tailwind UI markup aims to be accessible, but interactive components may require additional JS handling.
Follow WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices for building accessible UI components.

Dynamic Classes:
Elements needing dynamic classes for different states include comments specifying classes.
Example provided for adapting HTML for Alpine.js.

Transitions:
Recommended transition styles for dynamic elements provided in comments.
Example transition adaptation for Alpine.js included.

Creating Partials/Components:
Vanilla HTML examples include repetition; recommended to create reusable components.
Refer to "Extracting Components" documentation on Tailwind CSS website.

Using React:
Install dependencies: @headlessui/react, @heroicons/react.
React examples provided as single components; adapt as needed.
Break down examples into smaller components for project needs.

Using Vue:
Install dependencies: @headlessui/vue, @heroicons/vue.
Vue examples provided as single components; break down as needed.
Adapt examples to create reusable Vue components.

Resources & Assets:
Icons: Heroicons (MIT-licensed).
Images: Mostly from Unsplash for freely-usable photography.
Illustrations: Some examples use free Lucid Illustrations pack by Pixsellz.
Figma Assets: Discontinued, but customers can download the final release up to July 14, 2021.
