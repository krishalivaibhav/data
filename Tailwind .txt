Tailwind 

Using React:
Dependencies Installation:

Install Headless UI and Heroicons for React:

npm install @headlessui/react @heroicons/react

Ensure React version >= 16 is installed, as required by Tailwind UI, Headless UI, and Heroicons.

Creating Components:

React examples in Tailwind UI are provided as single components without assumptions about component structure or prop APIs.
Code examples use local variables to reduce duplication and enhance readability without enforcing rigid opinions.
Tailwind UI encourages breaking down examples into smaller components as needed for project reuse.
Example: Stacked list component
Initial component:
const people = [ /* Array of people objects */ ];

export default function Example() {
  return (
    <ul className="divide-y divide-gray-200">
      {people.map((person) => (
        <li key={person.email} className="py-4 flex">
          {/* Person details */}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

Adapted component:
function PersonItem({ person }) { /* Component code */ }

export default function PersonList({ people }) { /* Component code */ }

Tailwind UI serves as blueprints and patterns rather than rigid UI kits, allowing flexibility in component structuring and customization.


Using VUE
Dependencies Installation:

Install Headless UI and Heroicons for Vue:
npm install @headlessui/vue @heroicons/vue

Ensure Vue version 3+ is installed, as required by Tailwind UI, Headless UI, and Heroicons.
Creating Components:

Vue examples in Tailwind UI are provided as single components without assumptions about component structure or prop APIs.
Code examples use local variables to reduce duplication and enhance readability without enforcing rigid opinions.
Tailwind UI encourages breaking down examples into smaller components as needed for project reuse.
Example: Stacked list component
Initial component:
<template>
  <ul class="divide-y divide-gray-200">
    <!-- People list -->
  </ul>
</template>

<script>
const people = [ /* Array of people objects */ ];

export default {
  setup() {
    return { people };
  },
};
</script>

Adapted component:

<!-- HockeyTeamList.vue -->
<template>
  <ul class="divide-y divide-gray-200">
    <HockeyTeamItem v-for="team in teams" :key="team.id" :team="team"/>
  </ul>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    teams: Array
  },
};
</script>

<!-- HockeyTeamItem.vue -->
<template>
  <li class="py-4 flex">
    <!-- Team details -->
  </li>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    team: Object
  },
};
</script>
